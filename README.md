# ADNI subjects finder

This program helps to find subjects based on their diagnosis (CN, MCI, AD). It was developed for my personal longitudinal study to query those who converged or not, e.g., from CN to MCI, from CN to CN (stable subjects), etc.

This program is still in its early phase, so use it at your own risk.

To use the program, please, create **folder** 'CSVs' in the root directory and put there downloaded from the [ADNI website](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/access-data/) 'ADNIMERGE.csv' file. The file location: Study Data -> Study Info -> Data & Database -> Key ADNI tables merged into one table.

Please, make sure to have those packages installed:
* Pandas
* PySimpleGUI
